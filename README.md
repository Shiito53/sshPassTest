# sshPassTest
Welcome to SSH CEW (SSH cracking easy way) a personnal project without any abambition other than learning python and having fun.
For the moment this is really simple to use. Just download the project with ( or without the list of pass ) et launch the project with python and a list of password to test.
The format of the file is "pass1 pass2 pass3" with just space as a separator.

You can use your own password list if you want, just change the argument when you call the python code.

Example of execution :
  python3 sshTest.py your_file.txt

Enjoy your stay ! 
(Probably more comming up as long as the project interest me !)
